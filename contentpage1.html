    			<p>Pornography, as defined by McManus (1986), is any content primarily designed to sexually arouse, with a strong emphasis on explicit sexual themes. Online pornography refers to sexually explicit images and videos accessible and downloadable via the internet.</p>

    			<p>The Philippines ranked first globally in terms of average porn video viewing time per session in 2021, as reported by PornHub (Garcia, 2021). This alarming statistic has prompted the government to intensify its crackdown on online pornography, particularly child sexual exploitation. Authorities are determined to prosecute and imprison offenders, as cases of online sexual abuse involving minors have tripled.</p>
    			<p>The Philippines has launched a vigorous campaign against online pornography, especially child sexual exploitation, due to a significant increase in related cases. According to Cepeda (2022), online child sexual abuse cases surged by 264.6% during the COVID-19 lockdown from March to May 2020, reaching 279,166 cases compared to 76,561 cases in the same period of 2019.</p>
